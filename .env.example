# Copy to .env.local for local dev
# If USE_MOCK=true the API will load sample data from media_info.json instead of making the real network request.
# By default we call the real RocketAPI. Set USE_MOCK=true to force reading the local media_info.json
USE_MOCK=false
# When USE_MOCK=false, set the Rocket API token here
# ROCKET_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>  # e.g., TvQWTYSyTqck7ay0cnimvw
# RAPIDAPI_KEY=<YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY_HERE> # optional: used to fetch ad details (ads library) when ad ID is found
# Buckets used for direct-to-GCS uploads. Set this to your bucket name (e.g., closer-query-prod-12345)
# UPLOAD_BUCKET=<YOUR_GCS_BUCKET_NAME>
# Firestore collection used to store past queries (dashboard uses this):
# FIRESTORE_COLLECTION=queries
# For deployments without ADC (Workload Identity Federation), you may optionally set a service account JSON
# as an env var named NEXT_SA_KEY (not recommended for production). Example: NEXT_SA_KEY='{"type":...}'
# Required IAM roles for the service account used by the server:
# - roles/firestore.viewer (or roles/datastore.viewer) to read the `queries` collection
# - roles/storage.objectViewer to generate signed read URLs for thumbnails
# Ensure the service account used by your deployment has these roles on the project and bucket.

# Firebase client config (for browser)
# These are optional for local dev but required to enable Firebase Auth client
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<your-auth-domain>
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=<your-app-id>
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=<your-measurement-id>

# Server credentials for verifying ID tokens (recommended via ADC or service account)
# If ADC is not available, you may provide a service account JSON via NEXT_SA_KEY
# NEXT_SA_KEY='{"type": "service_account", ... }'

# In production, set the above env vars and restart your deployment to enable sign-in.
